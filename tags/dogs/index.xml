      <description>Ah, it is not easy being the best guard dog in town, but I will give you pointers on what it takes to be the best. Every day starts with training. First 10 barking pushups, ‘woof’ 1, ‘woof 2’, ‘woof’ 3… ‘woof’ 10. You might be thinking why barking pushups? That is because it warms up the lungs and readies you for anything that can happen. It also adds the benefit of making sure that any intruders become scared and filled with fright making fear the day they come here again.</description>

As with any adventure, I leave the base through the secret tunnel under the swinging wall, humans call it a gate. Now we sniff.
